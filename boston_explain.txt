This code is for building a binary classification model using a neural network with the Keras library. Let's go through it line by line:

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.datasets import imdb
from keras import models
from keras import layers
from keras import optimizers
from keras import losses
from keras import metrics
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```
This section imports necessary libraries including numpy for numerical computations, Keras for building the neural network, and matplotlib for plotting graphs inline.

```python
(train_data, train_labels), (test_data, test_labels) = imdb.load_data(num_words = 10000)
```
This line loads the IMDB dataset, which is a set of movie reviews labeled by sentiment (positive or negative). It loads only the top 10,000 most frequently occurring words from the dataset.

```python
print(type([max(sequence) for sequence in train_data]))
```
This line prints the type of the result of a list comprehension which finds the maximum index in each review. It's likely just for debugging or understanding the data structure.

```python
max([max(sequence) for sequence in train_data])
```
This line finds the maximum index value in the entire dataset, which is needed later for vectorizing the sequences.

```python
word_index = imdb.get_word_index()
```
This line retrieves a dictionary that maps words to their integer index in the IMDB dataset.

```python
reverse_word_index = dict([(value, key) for (key, value) in word_index.items()])
```
This line reverses the word index dictionary so that it maps integer indices to their respective words.

```python
decoded_review = ' '.join([reverse_word_index.get(i-3, '?') for i in train_data[0]])
decoded_review
```
These lines decode the first review in the dataset back into English words. 
The indices are offset by 3 because indices 0, 1, and 2 are reserved for "padding," "Start of Sequence," and "unknown."

```python
len(reverse_word_index)
```
This line prints the total number of unique words in the dataset.

```python
def vectorize_sequences(sequences, dimension=10000):
    results = np.zeros((len(sequences), dimension))
    for i,sequence in enumerate(sequences):
        results[i,sequence] = 1
    return results
```
This function converts the sequences of word indices into one-hot encoded vectors. Each row corresponds to a review, 
and each column corresponds to a word in the vocabulary. If a word appears in a review, its corresponding column in the vector is set to 1.

```python
X_train = vectorize_sequences(train_data)
X_test = vectorize_sequences(test_data)
```
These lines vectorize the training and testing data.

```python
y_train = np.asarray(train_labels).astype('float32')
y_test = np.asarray(test_labels).astype('float32')
```
These lines convert the labels (positive or negative) into floats.

```python
model = models.Sequential()
model.add(layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10000,)))
model.add(layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
```
This code defines the architecture of the neural network. It's a sequential model with three densely connected layers. 
The first two layers have 16 units each with ReLU activation functions, and the last layer has one unit with a sigmoid activation function, 
which outputs a probability indicating the sentiment of the review.

```python
model.compile(
optimizer=optimizers.RMSprop(learning_rate=0.001),
loss = losses.binary_crossentropy,
metrics = [metrics.binary_accuracy]
)
```
This line configures the model for training. It specifies the optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.

Continuing from where we left off:

```python
X_val = X_train[:10000]
partial_X_train = X_train[10000:]
y_val = y_train[:10000]
partial_y_train = y_train[10000:]
```
This section splits the training data into a validation set (`X_val` and `y_val`) and a partial training set (`partial_X_train` and `partial_y_train`). 
This is done to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data during training.

```python
history = model.fit(
    partial_X_train,
    partial_y_train,
    epochs=20,
    batch_size=512,
    validation_data=(X_val, y_val)
)
```
This line trains the model using the partial training data (`partial_X_train` and `partial_y_train`). 
It specifies the number of epochs (iterations over the entire dataset), batch size (number of samples per gradient update), and validation data. 
Training progress and performance metrics are stored in the `history` object.

```python
history_dict = history.history
history_dict.keys()
```
These lines extract training history, which includes metrics such as loss and accuracy, and print out the keys of the dictionary containing this information.

```python
loss_values = history_dict['loss']
val_loss_values = history_dict['val_loss']
epochs = range(1, len(loss_values) + 1)
plt.plot(epochs, loss_values, 'g', label="Training Loss")
plt.plot(epochs, val_loss_values, 'b', label="Validation Loss")
plt.title('Training and Validation Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Loss Value')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
These lines plot the training and validation loss over epochs. 
It visualizes how the loss changes over time during training, helping to identify if the model is overfitting or underfitting.

```python
acc_values = history_dict['binary_accuracy']
val_acc_values = history_dict['val_binary_accuracy']
epochs = range(1, len(loss_values) + 1)
plt.plot(epochs, acc_values, 'g', label="Training Accuracy")
plt.plot(epochs, val_acc_values, 'b', label="Validation Accuracy")
plt.title('Training and Validation Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
Similar to the previous plot, these lines plot the training and validation accuracy over epochs. It helps to visualize how the accuracy changes during training.

```python
model.fit(
    partial_X_train,
    partial_y_train,
    epochs=3,
    batch_size=512,
    validation_data=(X_val, y_val)
)
```
This part of the code trains the model for three more epochs, similar to the previous training step.

```python
result = model.predict(X_test)
```
This line makes predictions on the test data using the trained model.

```python
y_pred = np.zeros(len(result))
for i, score in enumerate(result):
    y_pred[i] = np.round(score)

mae = metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_pred, y_test)
mae
```
These lines compute the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the predicted labels (`y_pred`) and the actual labels (`y_test`). 
MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values, providing an indication of how well the model performs on the test data.
